## General Context

Finding new customers is vital in every industry. The process of finding new customers begins by learning as much as possible from the existing customers. Understanding current customers allow organizations to identify groups of customers that have different product interests, different market participation, or different response to marketing efforts. With this, we will be able not only to serve better our customers but also to improve the targeting of prospective customers.
Market segmentation, the process of identifying customer groups, makes use of geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics of customers. By understanding the differences between the different segments, organizations can make better strategic choices about opportunities, product definition, positioning, promotions, pricing, and target marketing.

## Expected outcomes

1. Explore the data and identify the variables that should be used to segment customers.
2. Identify customer segments
3. Justify the number of clusters you choose (taking into consideration the business use as well).
4. Explain the clusters found.
5. Suggest business applications for the findings and define general marketing
   approaches for each cluster.
